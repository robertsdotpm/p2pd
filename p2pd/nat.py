"""
Determine any numerical patterns in port mapping allocations.

Symmetric NATs use a new mapping for each destination + port.
By default this means you can't predict mappings. However,
it may still be possible if the NAT uses a predictable value
between mappings -- hence this is checked for.

The code here also distinguishes between 'dependent' and
'independent' delta types. Independent delta means NAT
mappings increase by n no matter what the source port
might be. It may be useful to differentiate this from a
delta type that is dependent on local ports because it's
more likely to have collisions seeing as how any outgoing
connection will increase the mapping counter.

Therefore -- this NAT type is poorly suited to concurrent
TCP hole punching and worth making the distinction for
even though the port prediction code for both is identical.

Note: Some delta type detections dependent on comparing the
value of the previous result. If concurrency is enabled
they results will be 'out of order' or unpredictable and
lead to invalid results. Concurrency is thus disabled.
This code is very badly written but it's at least tested.
