"""
Python's asyncio protocol classes seem to return human-readable
tuples that identify the packet's sender. At first glance this
seems to make sense. For people use the readable form of
addresses when working with them. But the network stack
needs it in binary form for routing. Hence, it will end up
having to convert an address to/from binary.

The problem is more complicated because IPv6 can have several representations of the same address in a readable form.
E.g. omitting zero portions with : or leading zero parts
of a segment. If you're trying to index a reply by an address it adds extra work because you have to normalize the address (for IPv6.)
Extra work means extra CPU.

Networking is generally supposed to be as fast as possible so
this design might not be ideal.

"""
In Python's asyncio code you can use so-called 'protocol' classes
to receive messages from an endpoint or server and then handle
them in real time. This is a very elegant way to do things
because the event loop handles polling the sockets to check
if there's any new messages for you vs you doing the check
yourself using await. The drawback is the protocol-style way
of networking basically uses callbacks and by itself -- doesn't
mix well with the async way of doing things. But with some small
tweaks it is flexible enough to do whatever you want.
