"""
The UPnP module implements IPv4 port forwarding (for NATs) and for IPv6
it provides the means to add exceptions to the router's firewall (which
it calls adding 'pin holes'.)

When using IPv6: the address to make an exception for must be the one
used to make the requests (this is handled automatically here.)
Therefore the interface used must be able to bind to the address
being added as an exception. IPv6 also requires these exceptions have
an expiry which maxes out at 24 hours (it's expressed in seconds.)
Thus, a worker process to re-add the exception at expiry is a good idea.

In IPv4 a lease time of 0 (unlimited) is allowed which is the approach
taken here. So duel-stack hosts will at least have one route that's
reachable. Assuming that the rules aren't wiped out after the router
is rebooted. It's quite possible they are. Maybe useful for security
and cleanup purposes. 

Finally, the response messages after port mapping can be inconsistent
with the true outcome of the request. In testing IPv4 port forwarding
on an Open-WRT VirtualBox VM using the miniupnpd package it replies
with a 501 error message when follow-up calls indicate the mappings
were created successfully. UPnP stacks aren't perfect.

    - The AV server does IPv6 and is useful for testing IPv6 code.
https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/virtualization/vmware#upgradedupdated_ova_for_openwrt21
    - This is a massive guide on how to get Open-WRT to run in VMWare.
    Do not follow the first part. Skip directly to the section that
    has an 'updated OVA for VMWare' this file is gold.
    Don't use VMWare for it. Open this in VirtualBox.
    It is configured to use LAN IP 192.168.1.1 by default. 

    This is important:
        - When you start the VM enter passwd and set a password for root
        - enter vi /etc/config/network
        - change 192.168.1.1 to an IP in the same subnet as the
        network interface you're using for the Internet.
        (press esc then i for insert mode. esc then :qw enter to save/quit.)
        - enter reboot to restart the VM.
        - You should now be able to visit that IP in a web browser.
        - Enter the root password you set or try blank.
        - Go to the software section and update it.
        - Install miniupnpd -- the config is at /etc/config/upnpd
        - Enable it in the config file and reboot again.
