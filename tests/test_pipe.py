"""
It turns out being able to successfully handle TCP close in server
protocol code is very important because otherwise you can't easily
write custom servers that handle cleanup for various client
data structures that may be made.

The bellow tests confirm that the regular TCP close sequence done
by 'well-behaving' clients (which involves a 4-way FIN ... ACK)
is supported. I've also written tests to check that RST works.
RST forcefully tears down a connection and the flag is usually set
during an error. You can also force it to be sent by toggling
the 'no-linger' timeout to 0 -- though this is considered bad practice.

I have confirmed that the appropriate packets are sent in Wireshark.
The below tests are working but I've only tested this on one OS
so far. Hopefully it works well on other OSes, too.
