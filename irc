# To the people who run this IRC server

You may have noticed some strange activity coming from users that reference
p2pd.net in their version information or from new channels in your server.
I wanted to let you know what this was about and that it wasn't being
used by botnets or any malicious software.

As you may know: the Internet relies crucially on the DNS system which
is a paid service that allows numerical routing addresses to be given
human-readable names. DNS works fine for most users but there are instances
where it makes sense to be able to register names for free without
the use of a UI (there is no standard way to register domains via API.)

I am the author of a networking library called 'P2PD' that allows people
to connect directly to each other. My software needs to use very long addresses
and has much the same issues as IPs do -- in that users need a way
to reference addresses. However, due to limitations in the domain name system
(and a desire to rely on public infrastructure) - there was only one alternative.

That's where IRC comes in. IRC can be conceived of as a simple key-value store
where each channel is the key and the topic is the value. Since topics are
protected by registered accounts -- it makes it possible to 'own' an entry.
Exactly the same way that one may own a domain. So I've built a simple
system on top of IRC that can be used in place of DNS for DDNS purposes.

## But what about spam?

One way I've tried to mitigate the potential for abuse is by setting the
moderator mode on channels. So at least the channels can't be used by botnets.
This is also a very good way to ensure that channels are automatically
deleted if they're not used. As chanservs are often optimized to delete channels
with no new messages in them after X days. The channel founder is
always free to periodically "refresh" the channel. Should they still require it.

Users of the system shouldn't need to use much bandwidth or resources
from the IRC server. This is true for channel owners, too. Perhaps there are
more measures to minimize abuse, but for now I think this is a good solution.
There aren't many users of my software at the moment so scalability isn't an issue.
This may not even end up being used. We shall see.
