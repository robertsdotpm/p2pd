# To the people who run this IRC server

You may have noticed some strange activity coming from users that reference
p2pd.net in their version information or from new channels in your server.
I wanted to let you know what this was about and that it wasn't being
used by botnets or any malicious software.

As you may know: the Internet relies crucially on the DNS system which
is a paid service that allows numerical routing addresses to be given
human-readable names. DNS works fine for most users but there are instances
where it makes sense to be able to register names for free without
the use of a UI (there is no standard way to register domains via API.)

I am the author of a networking library called 'P2PD' that allows people
to connect directly to each other. My software needs to use very long addresses
and has much the same issues as IPs do -- in that users need a way
to reference addresses. However, due to limitations in the domain name system
(and a desire to rely on public infrastructure) - there was only one alternative.

That's where IRC comes in. IRC can be conceived of as a simple key-value store
where each channel is the key and the topic is the value. Since topics are
protected by registered accounts -- it makes it possible to 'own' an entry.
Exactly the same way that one may own a domain. So I've built a simple
system on top of IRC that can be used in place of DNS for DDNS purposes.

## But what about spam?

I've implemented many ways to mitigate the potential for disruption.

1. The channels are set to private to avoid flooding the channel listing.

2. Channel names are uniquely determined by an algorithm that requires CPU
work to be done from clients to map names to values. This sets an upper bound on
how many channels can be created and the resolutions they serve per second.

3. Channels will expire naturally due to chanserv optimizations and the software doesn't aggressively attempt to refresh channels.

Lastly: it remains to be seen if my software will ever have any real users. So
the idea of 'spam' and 'degrading service' for IRC servers (while a priority for
me) remains a theoretical concern. But I'm open to improvements to my design
that may reduce server load and/or possible disruptions.
