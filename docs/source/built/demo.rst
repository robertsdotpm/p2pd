Peer-to-peer demo
===================

P2PD includes a simple text-based program to try out it's p2p networking
features without fooling around with code. After installing the
software try the command **python3 -m p2pd.demo**

The software will then load your network interfaces and
start a peer-to-peer node. You can select some basic options for the
program such as connecting to another peer. You can use the same
software to spin up another node to connect to.

Or run the software on another machine, get its address, and try that.
Should be a good way to see what the project is about. Output is similar
to the capture listed bellow.
