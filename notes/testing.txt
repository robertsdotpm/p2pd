When software engineers test their code they often do so on a

(1) Nix-based operating system
(2) And high-end machine

This has lead to the classic meme of 'well, it works on my computer...'
in software quality assurance. Well, yes, it does. But if you don't test your
code on the kind of systems your users run then you're in for a bad time. Your
average user isn't going to have a Gigachad 9000 System so slow code is
also going to be more of a pain point there.

Network code has the same problems as software testing but with the additional
problem that network state becomes something of the localized equivalent of
'it works for me.' What I mean by this is if you write code that works during
specific conditions and then ship that code -- your software and algorithms
might not be able to handle realistic behaviors of real-world networks.

A good example of that is high traffic DNS servers. Such servers may respond in
less than 1000 ms. But under high load they may take seconds or even never reply
before your programs timeout is reached. It's worth researching techniques to
inject different behaviors into a network stack when running test code. For
example: Netflix has a tool called 'chaos monkey' that randomly reboots services
to test graceful recovery.
