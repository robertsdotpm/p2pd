DNS deserves special mention cause its such a piece of shit. 

'No Internet connection.'
'No route to host.'
'Could not find host.'

Sometimes, when something breaks in a network nothing is wrong.
Sometimes, its just DNS 'working' as usual.

As I see it -- broken connectivity from DNS issues exposes the same
issues you see with network programming. Everyone chooses the laziest
possible approach. They let magical functions try to automatically
determine all behavior instead of specifying what they need.
Consequently, when the magic breaks so does the software.

You'll see that good software is written to bypass problems with
DNS. Browsers will hardcode some backup DNS resolvers and they'll
hardcode IP addresses for fallbacks. If the goal of P2PD is to
improve connectivity it must properly handle DNS failure. They
really are quite common on some networks.
